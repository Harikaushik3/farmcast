# 🌾 Intelligent Farmer Support System - Setup & Usage Guide

## Overview

The Intelligent Farmer Support System is a comprehensive agricultural decision support tool that provides:

- **Location-based data capture** (GPS, weather APIs, soil data)
- **Intelligent crop recommendations** with yield, profit, and sustainability scoring
- **Historical and seasonal insights** with trend analysis
- **Multi-day weather forecasting**
- **Voice assistant** with multilingual support (English/Hindi)
- **Offline-first caching** for reliable access

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set up API keys (Optional - system works with mock data):**
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_weatherapi_key
OPENCAGE_API_KEY=your_opencage_api_key
```

3. **Start the backend server:**
```bash
cd backend
python simple_server.py
```

The backend will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

## 📱 Using the Farmer Support System

### 1. Access the System
- Navigate to `/farmer-support` in your browser
- Or click "Farmer Support" in the navigation menu

### 2. Location Capture
Choose one of these methods:
- **GPS Auto-detection:** Click "Use Current Location"
- **Manual Coordinates:** Enter latitude/longitude manually
- **Sample Locations:** Try pre-configured Indian agricultural regions

### 3. Analysis Flow
The system automatically progresses through:
1. **Location Detection** → Weather & soil data capture
2. **Weather Analysis** → Current conditions + 7-day forecast
3. **Soil Analysis** → pH, nutrients, texture analysis
4. **Crop Recommendations** → Top 3 personalized suggestions
5. **Historical Insights** → Yield trends & seasonal patterns

### 4. Voice Assistant
- Toggle voice assistant with the speaker icon
- Supported commands:
  - "Tell me about the weather"
  - "What about soil conditions?"
  - "Recommend crops for me"
  - "Where am I located?"
  - "Show historical trends"
